**Music bot for Python (still in development)**

<br>

</div>

# Description

A lightweight and efficient music bot for Discord, written in Python. It uses `yt-dlp` to search for and retrieve audio from

YouTube and `discord.py` to interact with the Discord API.

# Stack

* Python 3.12.10

* Libraries: `discord.py` — the main library for working with Discord.

# Notes 

* User-Agent: The code uses a custom User-Agent to prevent blocking by YouTube (error 403).

*  Queues: Queues are implemented using `collections.deque` for high performance.
